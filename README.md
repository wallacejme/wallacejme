# 👋🏼Hi,

Wallace here.

I'm a Brazilian full-stack software developer. 🇧🇷

I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Sciences and I've been working as an IT Analyst since 2017.

My academic experience consists mostly in Java and Android development.
My work experience used to follow that, but I've also started working with Python and Django in Jan 2021.

I intend to specialize in a specific stack. It's not all set for now, but it'll probably involve Kotlin universe. Some of my progress on that journey will be shown here.
