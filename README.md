### üëãüèºHi,

Wallace here.

I'm a Brazilian software developer.

I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Sciences and I've been working as an IT Analyst since 2017.

My work and academic experience with software development consists mostly in Java and Android development.
At my current job, I work with Python and Django. That's as recent as January, 2021.

My next goal is to focus in a shorter set of technologies and dive deeper in them. As a first step, that will include improving my Android skills and mastering Kotlin, as well as getting better at Django for back-end purposes.

[**I write a blog** where I share my thoughts on the Software Development world](https://medium.com/escopos) (for now, published only in Portuguese).

For further information, you can [check my **LinkedIn** profile here ](https://linkedin.com/in/wallacejme).

(A sidenote: I love learning about natural languages. I fluently speak: `en`, `pt-BR`. On my to-learn list: `it`, `es`, `ar`.)
