### 👋🏼Hi,

I'm @wallacejme.

I'm a Brazilian software developer currently working as an IT Analyst.

I have a background in (mainly) Java and Android Development and a rough-ish understanding in front-end technologies.
I'm starting at Python and Django, and intend to dive deeper in mobile development.
