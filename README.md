# 👋🏼Hi,

Wallace here.

I'm a Brazilian software developer. 🇧🇷

I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Sciences and I've been working as an IT Analyst since 2017.

My work and academic experienceconsists mostly in Java and Android development.
At my current job, I work with Python and Django. That'd be as recent as January, 2021.

Right now, I'm defining a stack to specialize in. So far, I've considered the following technologies, so I'll start there:
- Front-end: Angular (web) and Android/Flutter (mobile).
- Back-end: Django and PostgreSQL.

Some of my progress on those technologies will be available in my Github profile.

[**I write a blog** where I share my thoughts](https://medium.com/escopos) on the Software Development world. For now, it's published only in Portuguese.

For further information, you can [check my **LinkedIn** profile here](https://linkedin.com/in/wallacejme).



### A sidenote:

I love learning about natural languages. I'm fascinated by their structure (typical programmer), and specially by the way they are unique at the same time that they share some essential concepts. I believe that teaches a lot about our nature. Not less important, learning languages is, maybe above everything, a thrilling and enriching cultural journey.

I fluently speak: `en`, `pt-BR`. On my to-learn list, I have: `it`, `es`, `ar`.
